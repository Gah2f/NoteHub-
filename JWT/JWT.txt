What is JWT 🤔💭 🤯💡? 

 JWT (JSON Web Token) is like a VIP pass 🎫 that lets you access certain areas of a system 
 without needing to log in every time. Let’s break it down with a fun analogy!

 Imagine you’re at a fancy movie theater 🎭, but instead of showing your ID every time,
 they give you a special VIP pass 🎟️.

How JWT Works 🤔
 1️⃣ Login & Get a Token 🏠🔑
  - You walk up to the counter (server) and say, "I want to watch a movie! 🎥"
  - The cashier (authentication system) checks your identity 🆔 and says, "Okay, here’s your VIP pass! 🎟️"
   (JWT is issued!)
  - You take it and think, "Hmm, now I can enter without proving myself again! 🤯"

 2️⃣ Using the Token to Access Stuff 🚪🎫
   - Every time you want to enter different areas (like arcade 🎮), 
    you just show your ticket 🎟️ instead of explaining who you are.

  - The ticket checker (server verification) just glances at it 👀 and nods, "Yep, you’re good! ✅"
    You think, "Nice! No need to explain myself again! 😎💭"

 3️⃣ Token Expiry & Security ⏳🔒
    But wait... Your ticket has an expiration time! ⏰
    If the timer runs out, you’ll have to get a new ticket 🔄 (log in again).
    If someone steals your ticket 🕵️, they could pretend to be you! 😱
    You think, "Hmm... I should keep my JWT secret! 🤫"

🧐 What’s Inside a JWT?
  A JWT is made of three parts 🧩: 
    
    📜 Header – Info about how the token is signed.
    📦 Payload – Contains user info like ID, roles, etc. 
    🔏 Signature – Makes sure no one tampered with it.

    Wait wait wait: You think, "Wait... So my token is like a signed document? 🤯📜
