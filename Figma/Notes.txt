key words:  
 🎨 1. Canvas
 Analogy: The floor plan you design on
 Explanation: The big open space where you place and arrange all your frames, components, 
 and elements—just like laying out rooms on a blueprint.

 🧰 2. Toolbar 
 Analogy: Your toolbox on the table
 Explanation: Contains all the essential tools—move, frame, text, shape—just
  like grabbing a measuring tape or pencil from your toolkit.

 🗂️ 3. Layers Panel
 Analogy: A stack of blueprints
 Explanation: Shows everything in your design from top to bottom, 
 helping you select and organize items—like checking what’s on the 1st vs 2nd floor.

 📐 4. Properties Panel (Right Panel)
 Analogy: Your customization menu
 Explanation: Where you tweak colors, sizes, spacing—like adjusting the height of a table or the paint of a wall.

 📁 5. Assets Panel
 Analogy: Your storage cabinet
 Explanation: Houses all your reusable items like components and 
 design systems—like grabbing decor or preset items from storage.

 📏 6. Rulers & Guides
 Analogy: Measuring tape & chalk lines
 Explanation: Helps align items precisely—just like ensuring a sofa is centered on a rug.

 🔍 7. Zoom Tool
 Analogy: Looking through a magnifying glass
 Explanation: Lets you zoom in/out on your design—like inspecting tile details or viewing the whole house from above.

 💾 8. Share Button
 Analogy: Inviting others to view the blueprint
 Explanation: Lets you collaborate and share your design with teammates or clients.

 💬 9. Comment Tool
 Analogy: Sticky notes on your plans
 Explanation: Allows others to leave feedback directly on the design—like leaving a note saying “move this window slightly.”

 🧱 10. Design/Prototype/Inspect Tabs
 Analogy: Switching roles: Designer 👷 → Tester 🧪 → Developer 👨‍💻

Basic terms
 Design: Where you create (draw plans).

 Prototype: Where you link and test (simulate walking through the house).

 Inspect: Where developers get specs (builders reading measurements).

Technical Terms 
 🏠 1. Frame
 Analogy: A room in a house
 Explanation: A frame is like a room that holds furniture (buttons, text, etc). 
 It defines the space and boundaries for your design elements.

 🧱 2. Component 
 Analogy: A template furniture set
 Explanation: Like buying the same couch for every room. 
 Components let you reuse designs like buttons or cards without remaking them each time.

 🪞 3. Instance
 Analogy: A copy of that couch in another room
 Explanation: When you place the same couch (component) in multiple rooms (frames), you’re using instances. 
 Change the original couch, and all copies update too.

 🎨 4. Styles
 Analogy: Wall paint and flooring presets
 Explanation: Styles save color, text, or effects just like saved interior design schemes you can apply to any room.

 🔗 5. Prototype
 Analogy: A walk-through demo of the house
 Explanation: You walk through doors (buttons) to see how rooms (pages) connect—this is what prototyping does in Figma.

 ✏️ 6. Vector
 Analogy: Drawing your house blueprint with rulers
 Explanation: Vectors are precise paths you draw. Like architectural plans, 
 they can scale up or down without losing quality.

 🧭 7. Auto Layout
 Analogy: Furniture that arranges itself automatically
 Explanation: If you add a new chair, the room adjusts to make space. 
 Auto layout moves and resizes elements for you.

 📚 8. Pages
 Analogy: Different floors in a building
 Explanation: Each page can hold separate designs—like the ground floor being the homepage and 
 the second floor the dashboard.

 📦 9. Assets
 Analogy: A storage room full of tools and decor
 Explanation: Assets are your saved components, icons, and images ready to be used across your project.

 🧰 10. Plugins
 Analogy: Extra tools you bring to decorate the house
 Explanation: Plugins add new features to Figma, like color pickers or
 image generators—tools to help you finish the job faster. 

🖱️ Mouse Selection vs ✍️ Vector Selection 

 1. 🖱️ Mouse Selection: 
       Analogy: 🧺 "Picking apples with a basket"
       Explanation:
         You're dragging a box (the basket) to collect multiple objects at once—like gathering apples from a tree.
         It selects everything inside the dragged area (shapes, text, frames). 
         Great for moving or grouping multiple elements quickly.

 2. ✍️ Vector Selection: 
     Analogy: 🧵 "Sewing with a needle, stitch by stitch"
     Explanation:
     You're tweaking anchor points and paths precisely—like stitching fabric with careful needle movements.
     Lets you adjust shapes by editing their individual points.
     Perfect for fine-tuning curves, corners, and custom drawings.

Auto layout: 🎛️ Auto Layout is like packing a suitcase 🧳
 Imagine you're packing clothes into a suitcase:

 👕👖 You place your shirts and pants neatly one after another.

 🧩 You want them to be evenly spaced so nothing is squished.

 🧼 You might want some padding around the edges (so your soap doesn’t crush your clothes).

 🔄 If you add more items (like socks 🧦), the suitcase automatically grows taller to fit them.

 📏 If one shirt is bigger, it pushes others nicely instead of overlapping.
 
 That’s Auto Layout in Figma:
 You tell the "suitcase" (frame) how to organize the "clothes" (elements), 
 and it does the layout work for you — spacing, resizing, alignment — all auto-magically! ✨
